Carousel Collection View layout
===============================

Simple and completely contained `UICollectionViewLayout` subclass that enables paging within collection view. Benefits above just turning on `pagingEnabled` is that your items can have sizes smaller than whole width of your collection (aka it snaps scroll position to center each item, see below).

## Usage

```
@interface CarouselCollectionViewLayout : UICollectionViewLayout

@property(nonatomic) CGSize itemSize;
@property(nonatomic) CGFloat interItemSpace;

@end
```

Just instantiate `CarouselCollectionViewLayout` instance and set its `itemSize` (which defines size of each item) and `interItemSpace` (which defines spacing between items).

Right now you can only select horizontal scrolling.
